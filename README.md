# PrePenny

Plan every penny before payday.

PrePenny is a money planner for people in the UK who live payday to payday. You type in what your bank shows today and every payment coming up, and it shows the balance left after each one, the lowest point ahead and when each debt is paid off.

The money engine is built (Phase 1, done 3 Nov 2026), and the app is being built in Phase 2: so far, Home and the Plan screen with Sam's example plan, where any payment can be changed, moved, ticked or removed and the change undone. See `PLAN.md` for progress.

## Checks

GitHub checks every change: lint, type checks and tests run on every push and pull request. To see them, open the repository on GitHub and tap **Actions**, then **Check**. A green tick means everything passed.

GitHub runs two sets of checks. **Lint, type checks and tests** checks the code and runs every engine and app test. **Build and end-to-end tests** builds the app and uses it in a real browser at 320px and 360px wide, as a phone would.

To run them on a computer, install Node 24 and pnpm 12, then run:

```
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm --filter @prepenny/web exec playwright install chromium
pnpm e2e
```

To look at the app on a computer while working on it, run `pnpm --filter @prepenny/web dev` and open http://localhost:3000/app/.

## Putting PrePenny online

The app is hosted on Cloudflare Workers (D68), on Cloudflare's free plan. GitHub puts it online by itself, with the **Deploy** workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

- every pull request gets its own preview link, posted on the pull request as a comment, and updated with each new commit
- every change merged into `main` goes to the live app, once GitHub's checks have passed on it.

To deploy an update, merge its pull request. Nothing else is needed.

The live app is at https://prepenny.prepenny.workers.dev/app/ (set up by the owner on 3 Nov 2026, D195).

### Setting it up the first time (the owner does this once)

GitHub needs permission to put the app on your Cloudflare account. Cloudflare changes its menus now and then, so a label may be slightly different from these.

1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up and make a free account, or sign in if you have one. Confirm your email address if Cloudflare asks.
2. In the menu on the left, open **Workers & Pages** (it may be under **Compute**). The first time, Cloudflare asks you to choose a **workers.dev subdomain**: a short name that becomes part of the app's web address, such as `prepenny-yourname`. Choose one and confirm it.
3. Copy your **Account ID**. On the **Workers & Pages** page it's on the right, under **Account details**, with a copy button. Keep it somewhere for step 6.
4. Make a key for GitHub. Tap the person icon at the top right, then **My Profile**, then **API Tokens**, then **Create Token**. Beside **Edit Cloudflare Workers**, tap **Use template**.
5. Under **Account Resources**, choose **Include** and your account. Under **Zone Resources**, choose **Include** and **All zones**. Tap **Continue to summary**, then **Create Token**. Copy the token straight away: Cloudflare shows it only once.
6. In GitHub, open the repository, then **Settings**, then **Secrets and variables**, then **Actions**, then **New repository secret**. Add two secrets, one at a time:
   - Name `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, with the token from step 5.
   - Name `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, with the Account ID from step 3.
7. Open the pull request, then **Checks**, then **Deploy**, and tap **Re-run all jobs** (or push any new commit). A few minutes later the pull request gets a comment with its preview link.

Until the two secrets are added, the Deploy workflow still builds the app but says "Cloudflare isn't set up yet, so nothing was put online".

The first time, before anything has been merged, the Deploy workflow puts the pull request's version online once as the live app too, because Cloudflare needs a live app before it can make previews of it.

## Bank holidays

The engine's copy of the UK bank holiday list is `packages/engine/data/bank-holidays.json`, downloaded unchanged from https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json by the **Bank holidays** workflow on GitHub. The file beside it, `bank-holidays.source.json`, says where it came from and when. To get a fresh copy, open **Actions**, then **Bank holidays**, then **Run workflow**. It only saves a new commit if the list has changed.

## Tax figures

The take-home pay calculator's figures for each tax year are in `packages/engine/src/pay/tax-years`, one file per tax year, with the GOV.UK page each figure comes from. The GOV.UK pages and HMRC's files they come from are saved unchanged in `sources/gov-uk/` by the **Fetch sources** workflow on GitHub, from the list of addresses in `sources/gov-uk.txt`. To fetch them again, open **Actions**, then **Fetch sources**, then **Run workflow**. A new tax year file is needed every April, and the tax year check warns from 1 March when next year's is missing.
